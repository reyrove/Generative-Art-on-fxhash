# Welcome to the fxhash Projects Repository by Reyrove! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

This repository is a collection of **unique generative art pieces** created with **JavaScript**, **p5.js**, and the **fxhash platform**. Each project in this repository is designed to create **infinite variations** of beautiful, code-driven artworks that can be minted as **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** on **fxhash**.

## About This Repository

**fxhash Projects** is where the boundaries of **art and technology** merge. The artworks featured here are **algorithmically generated**, ensuring each mint is completely unique. The magic of generative art comes from using **randomness** to craft one-of-a-kind pieces while maintaining a **signature style** across all iterations.

## Technologies Used

- **p5.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for creative coding, used to generate stunning visuals and interactive experiences.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: A native web tool for rendering 2D shapes and images, perfect for creating digital artwork.
- **fxhash**: A decentralized platform for minting generative art as NFTs, where each minted piece is generated in real-time using JavaScript.

## How to Explore and Run Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to explore and experiment with the different projects:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reyrove/fxhash-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Project**:  
   Move into the directory of the project you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd fxhash-projects/
   ```

3. **Open the HTML File**:  
   Each project comes with an `index.html` file that you can open directly in your browser. This will run the code and generate a new piece of artwork.

4. **Customize the Art**:  
   Every project allows for customization. Change parameters such as:
   - **Color palettes**
   - **Shape definitions**
   - **Random seed values**
   - **Animation settings**

   By modifying these values, you can generate completely new visuals and personalize the art to your liking.

## Project List

Here are some of the standout projects in this repository:

- **Bezier Curves**: Discover the beauty of flowing lines and intricate curves generated using advanced Bezier curve algorithms.
- **Brownian Graphe**: A visual exploration of Brownian motion, capturing randomness and chaos in a captivating graph format.
- **Citrus Mosaic**: Bright and vibrant geometric patterns inspired by the shapes and colors of citrus fruits.
- **Dreamscape Watercolors**: Ethereal watercolors blending together, creating soft, dreamlike visuals.
- **Elliott Wave**: A technical approach to art, visualizing market dynamics through waves and patterns.
- **Game of Life**: A timeless classic brought to life with codeâ€”a simulation of cellular automaton.
- **Fibonacci Fourier**: Merging mathematical concepts of Fibonacci sequences and Fourier transforms into striking visuals.
- **Girih Patterns**: Geometric Islamic art-inspired patterns rendered through code.
- **Spirograph**: Playful, intricate loops and curves, reminiscent of childhood spirograph designs.
- **Fourier Transformations**: Stunning visualizations of Fourier transformations across multiple dimensions.

...and many more! Each project explores different facets of **creative coding** and **mathematical beauty**.

## How to Use

Welcome to the FXHash Projects Repository, a collection of unique generative artworks coded using JavaScript, leveraging the power of p5.js and fxhash! This repository is home to a variety of projects that explore the intersection of mathematics, geometry, creativity, and randomness to create stunning, one-of-a-kind digital art pieces.
About This Repository

This repository houses several fxhash-based generative art projects, each featuring its own distinct theme, ranging from flowing curves and hypnotic ellipses to complex mazes and mesmerizing wave patterns. The projects are designed to be interactive and generative, meaning every iteration produces a unique piece of artwork based on a set of random parameters.
Projects Included:

Bezier Curves: Discover the beauty of flowing lines and intricate curves generated using advanced Bezier curve algorithms.

Brownian Graphe: A visual exploration of Brownian motion, capturing randomness and chaos in a captivating graph format.

Citrus Mosaic: Bright and vibrant geometric patterns inspired by the shapes and colors of citrus fruits.

Dreamscape Watercolors: Ethereal watercolors blending together, creating soft, dreamlike visuals.

Elliott Wave: A technical approach to art, visualizing market dynamics through waves and patterns.

Game of Life: A timeless classic brought to life with codeâ€”a simulation of cellular automaton.

Fibonacci Fourier: Merging mathematical concepts of Fibonacci sequences and Fourier transforms into striking visuals.

Girih Patterns: Geometric Islamic art-inspired patterns rendered through code.

Spirograph: Playful, intricate loops and curves, reminiscent of childhood spirograph designs.

Fourier Transformations: Stunning visualizations of Fourier transformations across multiple dimensions.

...and so many more! Each project explores different facets of creative coding and mathematical beauty.
How to Use

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/reyrove/fxhash-projects.git

Run Locally: To run these projects locally, simply open the HTML files in your preferred browser. Each folder contains an HTML file, which initializes the p5.js sketch for that specific project.

Explore and Experiment: Every project comes with parameters that can be customized to create new variations of the art. Feel free to tweak the code, adjust the color palettes, change the grid sizes, or introduce new shapes and algorithms. Let your creativity run wild!

These projects are designed for the fxhash platform, a generative art marketplace that allows collectors to mint unique iterations of generative artworks. The use of fxrand() allows every minted piece to be entirely unique and distinct from others, making every collector's artwork a one-of-a-kind piece.

If you want to mint your own version of these artworks or create something new, head over to fxhash and explore the possibilities.

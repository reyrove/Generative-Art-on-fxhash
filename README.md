Welcome to the fxhash Projects repository by Reyrove! This repository is a collection of unique generative art pieces created with JavaScript, p5.js, and the fxhash platform. Each project in this repository is designed to create infinite variations of beautiful, code-driven artworks that can be minted as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on fxhash.
About This Repository

fxhash Projects is where the boundaries of art and technology merge. The artworks featured here are algorithmically generated, ensuring each mint is completely unique. The magic of generative art comes from using randomness to craft one-of-a-kind pieces while maintaining a signature style across all iterations.
Technologies Used:

p5.js: A powerful JavaScript library for creative coding, used to generate stunning visuals and interactive experiences.

HTML5 Canvas: A native web tool for rendering 2D shapes and images, perfect for creating digital artwork.

fxhash: A decentralized platform for minting generative art as NFTs, where each minted piece is generated in real-time using JavaScript.

How to Explore and Run Projects

1. Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to explore and experiment with the different projects:

git clone https://github.com/reyrove/fxhash-projects.git

2. Navigate to a Project:

Move into the directory of the project you want to explore:

cd fxhash-projects/<project-name>

3. Open the HTML File:

Each project comes with an index.html file that you can open directly in your browser. This will run the code and generate a new piece of artwork.

4. Customize the Art:

Every project allows for customization. Change parameters such as:

Color palettes
Shape definitions
Random seed values
Animation settings

By modifying these values, you can generate completely new visuals and personalize the art to your liking.

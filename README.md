# 🎨 Generative-Art-on-fxhash

Welcome to **Generative-Art-on-fxhash** — a digital gallery where **algorithms become art** and every refresh brings a brand new masterpiece. This is your curated hub for exploring, remixing, and minting **generative artworks**, created with the magic of **JavaScript**, **p5.js**, and the **fxhash** platform.

## 💡 What Is This?

This repository is a **living collection of generative art projects**, each crafted with code and powered by **controlled randomness**. The goal? To create **one-of-a-kind artworks** that are:

- Visually stunning 💫  
- Mathematically inspired 🔢  
- Infinitely remixable ♾️  
- Blockchain-ready for minting on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz) 🔗

Every piece here is **unique**. Thanks to randomness, no two renders are the same—each one is a new expression of the underlying algorithm.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- **p5.js** — The creative coding library that powers everything.
- **HTML5 Canvas** — The visual playground for shapes, colors, and motion.
- **fxhash** — A decentralized platform for minting and collecting generative NFTs.
